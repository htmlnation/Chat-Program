# Chat-Program
I call this one a chat program but its not quite what it is unless you want to be creative and set it up on a few workstations and use it that way. In the screen shot you will notice a cool background and a nice little ico in the upper left. For this code I made a folder the same location as the .hta file called ext. inside the ext folder I have the .ico and other background .jpg files that show up. Also the file writes to a folder named c:\chat and to a file called Chat.txt You need to create that folder and file or you will get an error which I will provide a screen shot below. Items you can change or update to fit with what you are doing will be highlighted in the script. If interested in images you can download them at bottom of page.
